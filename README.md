# EndLock
This basically just stop people from going to the End on your server by using a raycast to determine if the player looks at a end portal frame teleport them back to their bed spawn.

Needs improvements and what not, but figured id show everyone the basics of what came from a simple question, probably isnt needed in most servers under 1.20 as you could just use GameStages to do this.
